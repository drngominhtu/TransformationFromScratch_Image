# Transformation From Scratch - Image

This repository is dedicated to implementing various image transformation techniques from scratch using Python. The purpose of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of how these techniques work under the hood.

## Features
- Implementations of core image transformation algorithms.
- Clear and well-documented Python code.
- Examples and tests to demonstrate the functionality of each transformation.

## Functions
Transformation methods implemented in the repository TransformationFromScratch_Image:
- Log Transformation: Enhances contrast for darker images using a logarithmic function.
- Thresholding: Converts an image to binary by comparing pixel values to a threshold.
- Identity Transformation: Leaves the image unchanged.
- Negative Transformation: Inverts the pixel values to create a negative of the image.
- Power Transformation: Applies a power-law transformation for contrast enhancement.
- Root Transformation: Uses a root-based transformation for adjusting brightness and contrast.
- Contrast Stretching: Adjusts brightness and contrast based on specified thresholds.
